  Travel time to the nearest starbase? That might've been one of the shortest
  assignments in the history of Starfleet. Talk about going nowhere fast. They
  were just sucked into space. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and
  call it a night - 'Commander'? Our neural pathways have become accustomed to
  your sensory input patterns. 


  Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Not if I weaken first. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? 


  I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.
